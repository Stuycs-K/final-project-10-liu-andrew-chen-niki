# Work Log

## Andrew Liu

### 5/22

Propose project ideas, thinking about encoding and decoding Hill Ciphers

### 5/23

Finish make file, work on formatting the inputs into lists or matrices in encode.py

### 5/24 

Continue formatting the triplet array and convert into num py for matrix multiplication

### 5/27 

Specify and clean up function parameters 

### 5/28

Finish the encode function, using np matrix multiplication and returning the encodede String

### 5/29

Allow user input to work with encoding, demonstrate the process of encoding through print statements.

### 5/30

Work on the generalization of the encoding so it no longer works for only triplets. 

## Niki Chen

### 5/22

Propose project ideas, thinking about encoding and decoding Hill Ciphers

### 5/23

Worked on README.md, brainstormed and outlined features to implement (specifically input modes), read about hill cipher.

### 5/24 

Looked at numpy documentation to see how we can implement it in our code

### 5/28

Finish the decode function, using np matrix multiplication and returning the decoded message

### 5/29

Researching hill cipher decryption method (inverse matrices, mod)

### 5/30

Debugging decode method (bug with finding the inverse keyMatrix)
Trying to implement different finding inverse method using determinant and adjoint matrix
